# Software Testing Portfolio

## Introduction

This repository contains my manual/automation software testing practice work, where I design and document test cases for real-world web applications.
It includes functional, negative, boundary, usability, and security-focused test cases created as part of my preparation for QA / Software Testing roles.

Along with software testing, I have a background in networking and cybersecurity, so I also focus on security-related test scenarios wherever applicable.

## Objectives of this Repository

-Build a strong manual testing portfolio

-Practice writing professional, industry-style test cases

-Apply testing concepts on real applications

-Develop a blend of QA + security testing mindset
